A take on the well-beloved frogger arcade game. See if you can help a princess find her way over the busy road to go for a swim - but beware of bugs, she's super scared of them!

## The game

The goal is to reach the water as often as possible while avoiding the bugs crossing the street. You can move the player with your keyboard - up, down, right and left. Each successful crossing will earn you 100 points. Hitting a bug will cost you a life. And since you only have three of them - *that's still more than most people but yeah, less than cats* - you should be careful. The game is over when you have lost all your lives. In the meantime try to score as many points as possible.
